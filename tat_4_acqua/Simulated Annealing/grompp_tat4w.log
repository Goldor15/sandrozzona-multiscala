Determining Verlet buffer for a tolerance of 0.005 kJ/mol/ps at 300 K
Calculated rlist for 1x1 atom pair-list as 1.258 nm, buffer size 0.258 nm
Set rlist, assuming 4x4 atom pair-list, to 1.214 nm, buffer size 0.214 nm
Note that mdrun will redetermine rlist based on the actual pair-list setup
This run will generate roughly 55 Mb of data
